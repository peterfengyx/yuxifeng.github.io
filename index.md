I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, Canada. I am a member of the Data Management and Mining Lab at UBC under the supervision of Dr. Laks V.S. Lakshmanan. Before that, I received a B.S. degree in mathematics from Tsinghua University, China. My research focuses on applications of natural language processing, including text generation, relation extraction, and fact-checking. Recently I also work on aligning large language models to downstream tasks like natural language to linear program models and natural language to SQL.
